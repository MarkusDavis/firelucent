## An official build of FireLucent using React, Material-UI, Firestore and Firebase.

👨🏾‍💻 This project was created by Markus Davis.

## ℹ️ Summary

This application uses private routes and some are public and some are private with authentication required. The user's profile, and registration information is stored in Firebase Firestore and the data is retrieved using a custom hook.
